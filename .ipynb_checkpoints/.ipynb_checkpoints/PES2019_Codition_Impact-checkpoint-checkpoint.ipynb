    "# **PES 2019 Condition Results**\n",
    "## Summary:\n",
    "In our analysis of the game PES 2019 when simulated within online events it is often questioned how large of an impact conditions play between teams. Within this project the impact of conditions will be explored using analytics to determine how great, if at all the impact of conditions has upon the results of games simulated on random conditions to give better information to those who watch and gamble on such simulations along with those who create teams. Within the analysis it is found that there is insufficient evidence to surpass a confidence interval of .03, meaning that it cannot be reasoned that conditions play any significant role beyond statistical noise regardless of how one is to organize and analyze condition’s impacts on results. \n",
    "## Introduction: \n",
    "To begin with PES 2019 is a soccer game for the PC, to which has a thriving community of players on its platform. Similar to this there is a large community that modifies and uses the PES 2019 simulation mode to stream games where modified teams play against each other in online tournaments. Many any activities ranging from gambling to attempting to win these simulations take place with these games AI simulated games. One question that has always been up in the air has been how greatly conditions, represented in the game by an arrow-colored purple, blue, green, orange, and red, impact the results of a game. It is common knowledge that purple conditions somewhat negatively impact a team, and that red conditions very positively impact a team, for when one has set the team entirely to red conditions against a similar team in purple conditions the red team will win almost every time; however, the question remains, how greatly does this impact teams that play in the competitive setting where random conditions are used? This leads us to ask our question to which will be analyzed throughout this project:\n",
    "#### **Question:** Do conditions mater in a significant or impactful way in a game in 2019 PES?\n",
    "For us to answer this question we will do the following: <br>\n",
    "First, we will collect data from the 4CC wiki with respect to group stage games that can be impactful to our question. <br>\n",
    "Second, we will manipulate the data we have collected such that we can perform analytic regression analysis on our data. <br>\n",
    "Third we will perform regressions on the data to see if we can reject the null and if not, how impactful conditions really are with regard to game performance. \n",
    "## Part 1 Conditions by Player\n",
    "First look at the question will first be viewed with regard to what impact each player has upon the results as the unit of analysis. That means for each and every player's condition will be the dependent variable. Similarly within this portion it will also be analyzed by breaking down each player by what position they play within their team and how the conditions impact those players' results.\n",
    "## Data Gathering:\n",
    "So the first thing we need to do is write a quick script to rip the data from the wiki and give us some data to work with. For the purposes of this I'll also save it on my computer as a .csv so that I can also look at it in Tableau before I heavily manipulate the data.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<small>**If you want to get the data as well just modify the directory for where to save it based upon your own computer.**</small>"

    "As we can currently see, there seems to be a disparity between the number of draws and wins/loss. This would make sense considering wins/loss would be propionate, and the chance of a draw probabilistically is less likely. <br>\n",
    "Two other big take away from the graph are that it would seem orange conditions overall has a larger chance of winning whereas green conditions have the greatest chance of losing with respect to count. Purple also seems to be more likely to obtain a loss. But all of these values seem to be not massive in telling a story one way or another. Another part that does not aid in this fact is our second easy observation. The data is distributed as a right skewed distribution. This means that not only are we more likely to have a loss in green conditions, but there will be more data that will muddy the water in this distribution. So it be worthwhile considering running a test to see if polynomial regression will work better then linear regressions. \n"

    "So how about in regards to breaking it down furthermore by player positions? Does that yield anything worth considering just upon first glance? Well, what it does show first and most notably is we will be lacking data for some positions. LMF, RMF, LWF, RWF all greatly lack in data compared to other positions. But all the other players have a good amount. And it also seems like the distributions are much less clean even for those with greater data. <br> \n",

    "As the data above indicates nothing was able to reject the null hypothesis that conditions play an insignificant roll in determining game results. Some results come closer, in general it would seem that of these trails when we look at conditions which are orange and good our p-values, that being our indicator of how likely we can reject the null, decreases making it more likely we can reject the null. This is also bolstered by the fact that both of these indicators tend to have the largest r-squared, or the largest significance in their trends. This isn't to say much though, given that nearly everything's chance of rejecting the null and ability to explain the trend is very bad. But the question is if we analyze this with regard to adding in the variable of conditions with respect to each position will certain positions show themselves to be affected by conditions?"

    "This time when observing the data, it becomes yet again clear how little impact conditions plays upon results. Again, not a null hypothesis is shown to be false, indicating that no position is adequately impacted by their respective condition. Again, the trend of orange conditions having the strongest impact bleeds through slightly, and it would seem that cmfs and cfs are the positions in which are most impacted. This isn't to say that they are impacted by any significant degree, but when compared to the other positions these two nearly reject the null when selecting for very binary data. Which is another thing to keep in mind, the less binary we make the data the lower the significance of any of the data points are. This indicates that even if the cf and cmf positions are more impacted its still unlikely that this is beyond statistical noise. To make this clear bellow I graph out the two respective cases where this can be seen in non-binary data, that being Result-Mod by Condition-Mod with respect to CMF and CF.\n",
    "## Part 2 Conditions by team aggregate:\n",
    "Our final look into the data will be looking at it on a team-by-team basis rather than the individual impact conditions can have on a player and/or its position. To do this we will reorganize the data into teams and their score lines. Then we will perform more regressions on the teams with respect to the number of each condition they have on their team, and then how that impacts goal differential (the number of goals score for or against a team) and their game's result.<br>\n",
    "So first the data needs to be reorganized. This will be done by breaking the data down into the following:\n",
    "### Data collecting\n",
    "1. #, Cup and Group, Match, and Team\n",
    "2. Number of players fielded, a linear increasing condition score, a ln condition score, and an exponential increasing score.\n",
    "3. Lastly the results will be broken down into the results based upon win, draw, loss and by how much the team was ahead/behind by in goals."

    "These are the results for team scores in conditions. As evident, it’s much more effective to control for players fielded and similar to the results observed within the regressions of individual player conditions the much more powerful regressions seem to be those observing results and draws compared to results of loses. However, none of the data passes the confidence interval at 97% and in fact comes out to be much smaller than a significant portion observed within individual players.\n",
    "## **Conclusion:**\n",
    "Across the large amount of data looked at we can come to the following conclusion.\n",
    "1. It’s unlikely that player conditions have impact on the result of a game to a significant margin. It may be the case that they have a tinny impact when in orange condition, but if they do it’s so small it’s almost entirely drowned out by statically noise.\n",
    "2. Player conditions do not seem to have a significant role on players of differing positions. It may be the case that they impact CMFs and CFs but similar to the orange conditions it is unlikely to impact the game beyond statistical noise. \n",
    "3. A team's total conditions are unlikely to impact the team's results when using the random condition setting. It is more likely that rolling a CMF or having a single orange player on the team will impact the game rather than rolling several orange condition players.\n",
    "Thus, it is much more likely that the major impacts of a game of PES 2019 when simulated are much more impacted by other variables not considered, such as:<br>\n",
    "What sliders the team is using, how the team was constructed, whether the team is green or red for its height distribution, the team's formation, ect. This is not to say that conditions do not have a roll or that when one is to use a non-random condition team the team will not be in a better situation, but that is to say that its unlikely conditions play a significant impact on the can be visibly seen."
